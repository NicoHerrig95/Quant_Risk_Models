# Quantitative Risk Models  (MSc Dissertation Repo)

### --> Repo contains parts of my MSc dissertation project, for reusage. Code provides a framework written in R for automated computation of VaR based on different time series models (GARCH, CMM, historical simulation) and experimental neural networks (LSTM-MDN architecture, implemented in python using TensorFlow/Keras framework).   

## Description
The repo mainly contains an automated pipeline downloading stock data, training various models for VaR calculation and running backtesting on each model. Code can be fully run via one-line execution (by running the **execution.R** script).
